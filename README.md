# JVM Readings

WORK IN PROGRESS

A list of papers and blog posts essential to understanding how the JVM works, and building high performance applications on the JVM. The list is curated and maintained by Reynold Xin ([@rxin](https://twitter.com/rxin)). If you think a paper should be part of this list, please submit a pull request. It might take a while since I need to go over the material.
